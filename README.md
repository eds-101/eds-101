### Hi there 👋

My name is Ed and I'm coding my way towards my first fulltime dev role.

In 2021 I was a Head of Tech and also learnt how to code from Makers Academy. I'm also an ex tech consultant 🥸

2022 goals: 
* Learning Solidity & the tech of the Blockchain world
* React, Typescript & Javascript

Currently reading 📚 (synchronously 😅):
* Clean Architecture - Robert C Martin aka Uncle Bob
* Clean Code - Uncle Bob
I pledge to use well considered variable names and conventions at all times.
